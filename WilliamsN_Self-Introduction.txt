My name is Nicole Williams 
I’m originally from Connecticut
I’m getting my AS in Java and moving to EMU for my BS
I like reading, video games, baking, and I own over 100 plants
I have 2 cats.
I’m planning to move into the programming field, but at the moment I’m a full-time librarian and I work to create online game content for them.
I look forward to working with everyone.
